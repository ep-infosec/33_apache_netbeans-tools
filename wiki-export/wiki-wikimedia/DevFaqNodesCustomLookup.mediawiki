===I need to add-to/remove-from/customize the content of my Node/DataObject/TopComponent's Lookup.  How do I do it?===

If it's just adding something, use
<source lang="java">
return new ProxyLookup(
    new Lookup[] { 
      super.getLookup(), 
      Lookups.fixed(
            something, somethingElse) 
      });
</source>

If there's only one object, substitute <tt>Lookups.singleton ( someObject )</tt>.

If you need to change the content of the lookup on the fly, it's a little more complicated, but not too much.  Use the above
ProxyLookup technique if there's a Lookup returned by the superclass and you still want to use its content.
What you'll use to change content on the fly is the combination of <tt>AbstractLookup</tt> (which, as fate would
have it, is not actually abstract), and <tt>InstanceContent</tt>, which is a grab bag of stuff you can add to and
remove from.


The result will look something like this:

<source lang="java">
class MyNode extends AbstractNode {
  private final InstanceContent lookupContents;
  public MyNode() {
    this(new InstanceContent());
  }
  private MyNode(InstanceContent ic) {
    super(Children.LEAF, new AbstractLookup(ic));
    this.lookupContents = ic;
  }
}
</source>

When you need to change the contents of your lookup, you can call <tt>InstanceContent.add()</tt> or and <tt>InstanceContent.remove()</tt>, e.g.:

<source lang="java">
lookupContents.add(someObject);
lookupContents.remove(someObject);
</source>

Your lookup will be updated to include all items in the InstanceContent.

====Custom Lookup Contents with DataObjects====
DataObjects have a Lookup, but also use an older variant on the Lookup pattern, called a <tt>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/CookieSet.html CookieSet]</tt>.  Since this is a somewhat bewildering term, and <tt>CookieSet</tt> will eventually be deprecated, you may want to avoid using it.  A <tt>CookieSet</tt> ordinarily provides the <tt>Lookup</tt> for a DataObject;  and certain APIs such as <tt>DataEditorSupport</tt> require it.

However, it is possible to work with the more modern idioms of Lookup as described above, with a few caveats.  Such a DataObject typically looks like:
<source lang="java">
public class FooDataObject extends MultiDataObject {
  private final Lookup lookup;
  private final InstanceContent lookupContents = new InstanceContent();
  public FooDataObject(FileObject pf, MultiFileLoader loader) throws DataObjectExistsException, IOException {
    super(pf, loader);
    lookup = new ProxyLookup(getCookieSet().getLookup(), new AbstractLookup(lookupContents));
    lookupContents.add (...whatever...);
  }

  @Override
  public Lookup getLookup() {
    return lookup;
  }

  @Override
  protected Node createNodeDelegate() {
    return new DataNode (this, Children.LEAF, getLookup());
  }
 //...
</source>

You can then add and remove objects from your <tt>InstanceContent</tt> and the <tt>DataObject</tt> will behave as expected.  

'''Caveat 1: You really must override <tt>createNodeDelegate()</tt>''' or otherwise (in your <tt>DataNode</tt> subclass) pass your <tt>DataObject</tt>'s <tt>Lookup</tt> to your <tt>DataNode</tt>'s constructor.  Otherwise its lookup will be <tt>getCookieSet().getLookup()</tt> and nothing added to your <tt>InstanceContent</tt> will appear in the <tt>Lookup</tt> of your <tt>Node</tt>.  So, ''if you use AbstractLookup in a DataObject, make sure its Node is really using your DataObject's Lookup''.

'''Caveat 2: A DataObject should always appear in its own Lookup''' &mdash; If you are ''really sure'' that nothing is going to use your <tt>DataObject</tt>'s <tt>CookieSet</tt> at all, you can omit merging <tt>getCookieSet().getLookup()</tt> into the <tt>ProxyLookup</tt> in the constructor.  However, many things will not work correctly if ''the DataObject itself'' cannot be found in its own <tt>Lookup</tt>.  If you are going to do that, replace <tt>getCookieSet().getLookup()</tt> with <tt>Lookups.singleton(this)</tt> to ensure it is present and cannot be removed or replaced.
