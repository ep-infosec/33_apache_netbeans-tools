The [[autoload]] in the [[NetBeans]] module system world means that certain module is turned on when ''needed''. In contrast to regular modules which require some manual action (user locating a module and activating it) to turn them on, the [[autoload]] modules are opaque for users and managed solely by the infrastructure. As soon as there is some module needing (by dependency or require/needs token) an [[autoload]] module, the infrastructure enables it.

In the [[Netigso|OSGi]] mode, the meaning of [[autoload]] remains as close as the original meaning. The bundle JAR is registered to the underlaying [[OSGi]] framework, but it is not ''started'' until there is some NetBeans module which would depend on the bundle. If there is no such [[NetBeans]] module, the [[OSGi]] bundle remains in ''installed'' state (or ''resolved''?).

The [[autoload]] mode is most suitable for [[OSGi]] bundles which shall be left in the full control of the [[OSGi]] container. For example there can be other [[OSGi]] bundles which may later ''start'' such bundles. Such enablement is outside of control of the [[NetBeans]] module system and is temporary (on subsequent launch of the system the module remains [[autoload]]).
