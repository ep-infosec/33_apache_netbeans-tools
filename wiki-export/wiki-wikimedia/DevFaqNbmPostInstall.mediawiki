===How to specify post-install code in [[NBM]]===

[[NBM]] allows to declare its own custom code in [[NBM]] archive. This code is called-back by <tt>Autoupdate/Updater</tt> at the end of installation of [[NBM]] into IDE.

<pre>

your_module.nbm
     |   
     +- Info
     |   |
     |   +--- info.xml
     |
    +- netbeans
        |
        +--- modules...
    |
    +-main
        |
        +--- main.properties
        +--- <custom code>

</pre>

If Autoupdate/Updater detects <tt>main</tt> directory in the NBM archive then <tt>main.properties</tt> descriptor contains information about the own code. <tt>Updater</tt> runs specified Java code according to these properties.

The properties expected in ''main.properties'' are:
{| border=1 class="simple"
!Property
!Value
|- 
| mainClass
| name of the main class, run after module installation from the NBM
|- 
| relativeClassPath
| classpath elements, may contain more elements
|- 
| jvm.parameters
| properties for JVM, arguments inserted before the main class name
|- 
| mainClass.arguments
| more arguments for the main class, added after the main class name
|}


The run command is built on top of properties above.

[[#1 | #1]] '''Problem''': There was a bug: variable <tt>%IDE_USER%</tt> contained as same value as <tt>%IDE_HOME%</tt> i.e. both links to the platform cluster directory and %IDE_HOME% '''didn't''' contain user directory as should be. It was fixed in NetBeans 6.5 platform.

The properties can contain several special variables which <tt>Autoupdate</tt> replaces by real values:
{| border=1 class="simple"
!Variable
!Value
|- 
| %IDE_HOME%
| platform directory
|- 
| %IDE_USER%
| user directory [[1 | 1]]
|- 
| %FS%
| file separator char
|- 
| %PS%
| path separator char
|- 
| %JAVA_HOME%
| the current Java home
|}


====Example====
* Download and unzip a project [[Media:samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.zip| samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.zip]]
* Go into <tt>samplepostinstall/main</tt> directory
* In <tt>main</tt> directory is main class <tt>Hello</tt> which should use most of possibilities of ''post-install'' hooks
:* Using properties <tt>mainClass</tt>, <tt>relativeClassPath</tt>, <tt>jvm.parameters</tt> etc.
:* Reads all special variables like <tt>%IDE_HOME%</tt>, <tt>%JAVA_HOME%</tt> etc.
:* Opens some GUI
:* Runs a JDK demo

To see that <tt>samplepostinstall</tt> project in action
# download [[Media:org-netbeans-samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.nbm| NBM]]
# run NetBeans IDE (6.0 or newer)
# invoke ''Tools|Plugins'' and switch to ''Download'' tab
# add the downloaded NBM
# install it and then watch post-install hook what will be executed while installing that plugin
