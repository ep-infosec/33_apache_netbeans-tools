===How do I specify the order for my menu items/toolbar buttons/files in the system filesystem?===

If you are using module development support the IDE,
you can manage the order of menu or toolbar items
by the help of special node '''XML Layer'''
which can be found underneath your '''Important Files'''.
Just find your menu/toolbar item and drag and drop it wherever you need.
Appropriate content in the project metadata (layer file) will be generated for you.
If this does not work, or you want to know more, read on.

<tt>FileObject</tt>s ([[DevFaqFileObject]]) in a folder have no defined order by default.
You can use <tt>FileUtil.getOrder</tt> to sort them.
(<tt>DataObject</tt>s ([[DevFaqDataObject]]) in a folder are always sorted this way.)
The order is determined by numeric <tt>position</tt> attributes.
For all details, see: [[FolderOrdering103187]]

Applies to: NetBeans 6.5 and later
