===Is it safe to programmatically modify a file which is open in the editor?===

It is not safe to modify a <tt>FileObject</tt> (via <tt>getOutputStream</tt>) which is open and ''modified'' in the editor. In fact, it is not possible: calling <tt>FileObject.lock()</tt> will fail. If you modify the <tt>java.io.File</tt> (bypassing the Filesystems API) you may cause a conflict.

If the file is not modified in the editor (easily checkable via <tt>DataObject.isModified()</tt>) then after your output stream is closed the file will be reloaded with the new contents.

If the file ''is'' modified you can make changes to the open editor buffer: use <tt>EditorCookie</tt> to acquire the Swing <tt>Document</tt> and make changes through that. It may be considered impolite to then save the file if it was modified before.
