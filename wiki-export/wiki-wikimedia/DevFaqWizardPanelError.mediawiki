====Q: How do I show that a user has filled an invalid input into my wizard?====

A: Set the <tt>WizardPanel_errorMessage</tt> property in the WizardPanel instance that is related to the displayed panel. 

Example:

<tt>wizardDescriptor.putProperty("WizardPanel_errorMessage", NbBundle.getMessage(MyPanel1.class, "key"));</tt>

'''''Note''''': Since WizardDescritor, spec.version 7.8 (i.e.since [http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html NetBeans 6.5 Platform])
* you can use <tt>WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE</tt> instead of "WizardPanel_errorMessage".
* beside <tt>WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE</tt> you can also use <tt>WizardDescriptor.PROP_WARNING_MESSAGE</tt> for warning messages or <tt>WizardDescriptor.PROP_INFO_MESSAGE</tt> for information messages.
* All kind of messages will be badged with appropriate icons: error [[File:Error.gif]], warning [[File:Warning.gif]], info [[File:info.png]]
* To clean the message just call <tt>wizardDescriptor.putProperty(WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE, null);</tt>

You can obtain the instance of <tt>WizardDescriptor</tt> in the <tt>WizardDescriptor.Panel.readSettings</tt> as <tt>settings</tt> parameter method.

==Update in NetBeans 6.8==
Two new methods in <tt>NotifyDescriptor</tt> were added to allow API client to create [http://bits.nbextras.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-dialogs/org/openide/NotificationLineSupport.html NotificationLineSupport] which allow handling error/warning/info messages in dialogs. If a dialog descriptor creates this support, <tt>DialogDisplayer</tt>  allocates necessary space at the bottom of dialog where API clients can set info/warning/error messages with appropriate icons.
