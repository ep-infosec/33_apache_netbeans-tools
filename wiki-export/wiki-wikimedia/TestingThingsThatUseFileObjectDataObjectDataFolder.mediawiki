===Testing Things That Use FileObject/DataObject/DataFolder===

If your unit tests use <tt>FileObject</tt> (including <tt>DataObject</tt> or <tt>DataFolder</tt>), then you may be suprised that <tt>FileUtil.toFileObject(java.util.File)</tt> returns <tt>null</tt>. This is because the MasterFS filesystem implementation is what maps <tt>FileObject</tt>s to your local disk and it needs to be on the classpath when tests are run.

See [[UsingFileSystemsMasterfs | UsingFileSystemsMasterfs]] for more info on how to fix this.

If for some reason you prefer not to use MasterFS, you can create a new <tt>LocalFileSystem</tt>, create some files and use that instead of <tt>FileUtil.toFileObject</tt> in your test.  For example, in a <tt>NbTestCase</tt> subclass:

<pre>
FileObject dir;
public @Override void setUp() throws Exception {
  super.setUp();
  clearWorkDir();
  LocalFileSystem fs = new LocalFileSystem();
  fs.setRootDirectory(getWorkDir());
  dir = fs.getRoot();
}
</pre>

If your test just needs some simple data in a FileObject or two, you can avoid writing to disk at all as follows:
<pre>
FileObject dir;
public @Override void setUp() throws Exception {
  super.setUp();
  dir = FileUtil.createMemoryFileSystem().getRoot();
  //write out data your tests will use to files under dir/ here
}
</pre>

If you want to write tests for a <tt>DataObject</tt> or <tt>DataLoader</tt>, you may also want to set the mime type correctly: [[DevFaqTestDataObject | DevFaqTestDataObject]]
