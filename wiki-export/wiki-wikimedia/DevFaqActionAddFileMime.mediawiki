===How do I add an action to a file of a given mime-type?===

The simplest way is to run '''File''' > '''New...''' > '''Module Development''' > '''Action''' which creates an action for you and registers it in your <tt>layer.xml</tt>.
# On the first tab, choose '''Conditionally Enabled''' action and select <tt>DataObject</tt> as the cookie class.
# On the second tab, check '''File Type Context Menu Item''' and choose the MIME type and position.

You can use <tt>text/html</tt>, <tt>text/x-java</tt>, <tt>text/x-ant+xml</tt>, <tt>text/x-jsp</tt>, <tt>image/png</tt>, etc.
