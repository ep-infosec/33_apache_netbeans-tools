===How can I change my TopComponent to not be a singleton (NB version up to 6.9)?===
The "New Window Component" wizard in the NetBeans IDE generates a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern singleton] TopComponent.  That's fine for windows that there should only be one of.  Particularly if you are [[DevFaqEditorTopComponent|creating some kind of editor]], you will want to create multiple instances of your TopComponent.
====The really easy way====
If you have not already used the '''New Window''' template to create your TopComponent subclass, don't.

Instead, use ''New &gt; JPanel Form''.  Once the new JPanel is created, switch to the Code tab, and replace <tt>extends javax.swing.JPanel</tt> with <tt>extends TopComponent</tt>.  Then do the following things:
* Override <tt>getPersistenceType()</tt>.  
** If you ''do not'' want your components reopened on restart
***return <tt>PERSISTENCE_NEVER</tt>&mdash;that is all you need to do to make sure they are not preserved across restarts.
** If you ''do'' want your components reopened on restart, then
*** return <tt>PERSISTENCE_ONLY_OPENED</tt> from <tt>getPersistenceType()</tt>
*** Add the following slightly-cryptic annotation to the class: <tt>@ConvertAsProperties(dtd = "-//com.yourmodule.yourpackage//YourTopComponent//EN", autostore = false)</tt>, replacing the package and class name with your own.  This identifies a DTD.  You do not need to define the DTD.  You just need to give it a unique namespace that nothing else is using.  Package and class name work well for that.
*** Add two additional methods (you are not overriding anything and they can be package-private, like serialization methods):
**** <tt>void writeProperties(Properties p)</tt> - here we will call <tt>p.put()</tt> passing enough information to reconstruct your component on restart.  If we are editing a file, we might save the path to the file.  If we are viewing a URL, we might save the URL.  If we want to be particularly fastidious, we might save the scroll position, or what line the editor caret was on , or anything else useful to restore the state of our component.
**** <tt>void readProperties(Properties p)</tt> - here we will reading whatever keys we wrote out in <tt>writeProperties</tt> and (re)initializing the component to its pre-shutdown state.  This method will be called on startup to restore our component to its pre-shutdown state as best can be done.  If we were, say, editing a file that no longer exists, the appropriate thing to do is throw an exception.  

====If you already have a generated singleton TopComponent subclass====
The good news is that you won't have to write any code -- you'll just have to delete some of the code that was generated for you.

In your TopComponent's .java source file:
* Delete the static <tt>instance</tt> variable, which ought to be declared a few lines above the constructor.
* Make sure your TopComponent class is <tt>public</tt>
* Make sure your TopComponent has a no-argument constructor which is <tt>public</tt>
* Delete the <tt>getDefault()</tt> method (typically somewhere around the middle of the file)
* Delete the <tt>findInstance()</tt> method (which typically follows the <tt>getDefault()</tt> method)
* Update the persistence code which saves your component's state on shutdown and restores it on restart to reopen your component as follows
** Locate the <tt>getPersistenceType</tt> method and change its return value to either <tt>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#PERSISTENCE_NEVER TopComponent.PERSISTENCE_NEVER]</tt> or <tt>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#PERSISTENCE_ONLY_OPENED TopComponent.PERSISTENCE_ONLY_OPENED]</tt> (see below for why).
** If you have methods called <tt>writeReplace()</tt>and an inner class called <tt>ResolvableHelper</tt> (NetBeans 6.8 and earlier):
*** Delete the <tt>writeReplace()</tt> method (typically towards the end of the file)
*** Delete the <tt>ResolvableHelper</tt> inner class (typically towards the end of the file)
** If you ''do not want persistence across restarts'' &mdash; you are returning PERSISTENCE_NEVER from <tt>getPersistenceType()</tt>
*** If you have a <tt>@ConvertAsProperties</tt> annotation and <tt>readProperties(Properties)</tt> and <tt>writeProperties(Properties)</tt> methods, delete the annotation and both methods
** If ''do want persistence across restarts'' &mdash; you are returning <tt>PERSISTENCE_ONLY_OPENED</tt> from<tt>getPersistenceType()</tt>
*** If you already have the <tt>@ConvertAsProperties</tt> annotation and <tt>readProperties(Properties)</tt> and <tt>writeProperties(Properties)</tt> methods just leave them there
*** If you do not have the annotation and those methods, implement them as described in the previous section

Next we will need to delete the metadata that registers the component:
* For version 6.9 of NetBeans:
** Delete the settings XML file for your component.  If your component class is <tt>MyWindow</tt> then that file will be in the same folder and will be called <tt>MyWindowSettings.xml</tt>.
** Delete the [[DevFaqWindowsWstcrefAndFriends| wstcrf]] (&quot;window system TopComponent reference&quot;) XML file in that folder.  If your component class is <tt>MyWindow</tt> then that file will be named <tt>MyWindowWstcrf.xml</tt>
** Edit your module's [DevFaqModulesLayerFile| layer.xml file] to 
*** Remove any references to either of these files (just use Ctrl-F to search for e.g. <tt>MyWindowSettings.xml</tt> and <tt>MyWindowWstcrf.xml</tt>).  They will be in <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> tags.
*** If you have removed a <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> entry, and it was the only entry in that folder, you can remove the XML for parent folder (and its parent if it is now empty, and so forth)
*** Find where an Action is registered for to open your (formerly) singleton TopComponent
**** ''NetBeans 6.9 and later:''  
***** Look for an <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> registered in <tt>Actions/Window</tt>in the XML file.  It will have an <tt>&lt;attr&gt;</tt> element that refers to your TopComponent class, e.g. <tt>&lt;attr name=&quot;component&quot; methodvalue=&quot;com.foo.MyWindow.findInstance&quot;/&gt;</tt>.  Delete the entire <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> entry.
***** Look for <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> entry for a <tt>.shadow</tt> file in <tt>Actions/Menu</tt> in the XML, with its <tt>originalFile</tt> pointing to the file entry you just deleted.  Delete the <tt>.shadow</tt> <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> too.
**** ''NetBeans 6.8 and earlier:''  
***** There will be an <tt>Action</tt> class in your sources which is registered, e.g. <tt>MyWindowAction.java</tt>.  Delete the java source file.
***** Look for an <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> registered in <tt>Actions/Window</tt>in the XML file.  It will be a <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> whose name is the munged fully-qualified class name of the <tt>Action</tt> you just deleted, e.g. <tt>com-foo-MyWindowAction.instance</tt>.  Delete the <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> entry for it
***** Look for <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> entry for a <tt>.shadow</tt> file in <tt>Actions/Menu</tt> in the XML, with its <tt>originalFile</tt> pointing to the file entry you just deleted.  Delete the <tt>.shadow</tt> <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> too.

====Creating And Opening Your TopComponents====

Now that you have deleted the actions for your TopComponent, presumably they will be created some other way (for example, from a file's popup menu).  You can create new instances of your TopComponent, open them and give them focus as follows:
 TopComponent win = new MyTopComponent();
 win.open();
 win.requestActive(); 
If you wrote your persistence code correctly, your components will magically reopen on restart with no further work.

====What About PERSISTENCE_ALWAYS?====
There is one other value you can return from <tt>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getPersistenceType() TopComponent.getPersistenceType()]</tt>.  That value is <tt>TopComponent.PERSISTENCE_ALWAYS</tt>.

While it is ''legal'' to return this value from a non-singleton TopComponent, it is almost never what you want to do.  What will happen if you do this is:
* Every instance of your component that is '''ever created''' will be persisted on shutdown, ''forever''
** Even if it is closed
** Even if nothing can use it, or it represents a file that was deleted, or is in some other way invalid
** Even if no code will ever be able to find it and open it again
* One every restart, ''forever''
** Every instance of your component that has ''ever existed'' will be read back from disk
*** Each one will slow down startup a little bit
*** Each one will be wasting disk space

<tt>PERSISTENCE_ALWAYS</tt> is for singleton components that need to be remembered forever across restarts. Don't use it for non-singletons.
====If you do not have any persistence code, but your components are reopening on restart...====
You are returning either <tt>PERSISTENCE_ONLY_OPENED</tt> or <tt>PERSISTENCE_ALWAYS</tt> from <tt>getPersistenceType()</tt>.  If there is no persistence code, but you ''are'' returning one of these values, NetBeans will use plain old Java serialization to store and reload your component.

Either use <tt>PERSISTENCE_NEVER</tt> or write persistence code as described above.  Serialization is slower and more fragile than proper persistence, and is never a good option for production code.
