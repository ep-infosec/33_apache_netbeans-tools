==Which Way Should I Use To Register an Object in the Default Lookup?==

There are two ways to put something in the [[DevFaqLookupDefault|default Lookup]]:

{|- border=1 class="simple" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFF9EF;"
! What
! When to Use It
! How
|-valign="top"
| Use the <code>@ServiceProvider</code> annotation
| Most of the time, unless you are building with Maven.  This annotation relies on NetBeans' build infrastructure to generate flat files in <code>META-INF/services</code> described below, at compile time.
| Annotate your file with <code>@ServiceProvider(service=Something.class)</code>
|-valign="top"
| Put an <code>.instance</code> file in your module layer in <code>Services/Hidden</code>
| Rarely - useful if you are making services available dynamically on the fly, for example when [[DevFaqDynamicSystemFilesystem|dynamically changing layer contents]], or when [[DevFaqFileAttributes|specialized registration metadata]] or factory methods are needed
| Declare a [[DevFaqInstanceDataObject|.instance file]], a [[DevFaqDotSettingsFiles|.settings file]] or similar, or a [[DevFaqDotShadowFiles|.shadow file]] in your module's [[DevFaqModulesLayerFile|layer.xml file]]
|}
