===How do I handle cut, copy and paste?===

The subject of properly handling cut, copy and paste is underdocumented in modern material on the NetBeans Platform and I am not aware of any clear and concise examples that show how to handle all aspects of these common actions.  Anyone who can improve these shortcomings would be doing a great service for the NetBeans Platform developer community.

The [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html#edit Nodes API documentation] provides some guidance, while chapter 14 of ''NetBeans: The Definitive Guide'' [http://www.netbeans.org/download/books/definitive-guide/html/apis-c_betterexplorer.html#N400551 goes into greater detail].  Although some parts of ''NetBeans: The Definitive Guide'' are now outdated, the portions related to the Nodes API are likely still relevant.
