===How to change selected tab of Multiview?===
Using <code>org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViews</code> you can get an instance of <code>org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViewHandler</code>.

For example: Get the handler for the current TopComponent

<pre>
TopComponent activated = WindowManager.getDefault().getRegistry().getActivated();
MultiViewHandler mvh = MultiViews.findMultiViewHandler(activated);
</pre>

Using this handler you can call 
* <code>getPerspectives()</code> to get all available tabs
* <code>requestActive/requestVisible(MultiViewPerspective desc)</code> to activate the tab
