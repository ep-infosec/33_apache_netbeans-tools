===Where is <tt>TopManager</tt>? I'm trying to do the examples from the O'Reilly book===

The O'Reilly book is old (written between 2001 and 2002) - the chapters on architectural background will still work, but many of the examples won't.

The generation of NB it was written for is from before Lookup (see [[DevFaqLookup | DevFaqLookup]]) was in use. <tt>TopManager</tt> was a class with a bunch of static methods for getting service objects.
It is now gone.

For pretty much everything available via <tt>TopManager</tt>, simply take the class you were looking for and try <tt>SomeClass.getDefault()</tt> - that's typically the modern way to do this sort of thing.  <tt>TopManager</tt> caused a tangle of interdependencies between different APIs that it was very desirable to remove.

If you were calling <tt>TopManager.getDefault().getPlaces().nodes().projectDesktop()</tt> in a NetBeans 3.x based application, there is no direct equivalent in NB 4.0 and later.  Rather, there is a rich set of project-related APIs which can be used for various purposes. As a rule, there is no 1-to-1 conversion from the above idiom to NB 4.0+; the affected O'Reilly examples would need to be rewritten to make sense today.
