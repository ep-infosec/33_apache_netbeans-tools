===Why use this strange convention - wouldn't a Map be good enough?===

Other platforms do use string-keyed maps for this sort of thing, but there are some weaknesses with that approach:
# it is impossible to enforce [[DevFaqModuleDependencies| dependencies]].  With <tt>[[DevFaqLookup| Lookup]]</tt>, a module's code cannot request an object of type X unless it can load/access the <code>X.class</code>. The module trying to look up an X will not be able to see <code>X.class</code> unless it [[DevFaqModuleDependencies|declares a dependency]] on the module that defines X ''and'' the module which defines X says that it allows access to the Java package X lives in. (A <tt>Map&lt;Class&lt;T&gt;,T&gt;</tt> would do the same job as <tt>Lookup</tt>.)
# The class of values in a map can change without notice - so if you have <tt>(SomeIface) foo = (SomeIface) globalMap.get("foo")</tt>, some new version of the module that provides "foo" can change the return type, causing <tt>ClassCastException</tt> s;  with <tt>Lookup</tt>, you cannot ever get an object that is not of the type you passed in the request - so Lookup's approach is more robust.
# <tt>Lookup</tt> supports listening to changes in the result.
# <tt>Lookup</tt> supports multiple instances for one key - if you call <code>lookup(X.class)</code> you get one instance.  If you call <code>lookupAll(X.class)</code> you get a <code>Collection&lt;? extends X&gt;</code> (so with <code>lookupAll()</code> it is more like a <tt>Map&lt;Class&lt;T&gt;,List&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>)

There are some other capabilities of <tt>Lookup</tt> (such as getting the specific type or number of results without actually creating objects, and providing named result items) but these are rarely used in practice.

<tt>Lookup</tt> is very powerful, yet simple and generic;  people quickly learn to love it, once they realize what it can do.
