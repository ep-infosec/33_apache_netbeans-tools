===How do I run some code when my module starts/loads/unloads?===

To run some code when your module is loaded, and basically every time the IDE starts and your module is enabled, simply create a subclass of <tt>org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall</tt> and override the <tt>restored()</tt> method. Bear in mind that this is being executing during the time the IDE/platform is starting up. You should limit the work you do here to that which is absolutely necessary.

Once the class is created, you must declare it in your module's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> file, like so:

<pre>
OpenIDE-Module-Install: org/netbeans/modules/editor/EditorModule.class
</pre>

Likewise, to execute code when the IDE is shutting down, you can override the <tt>close()</tt> method. This method of <tt>ModuleInstall</tt> is called when the IDE is shutting down, contrary to the <tt>closing()</tt> method, which is called to alert the module that the IDE is about to shut down. However, another module may veto the shutdown by returning <tt>false</tt> from the <tt>closing()</tt> method, so the <tt>close()</tt> method is best for performing any cleanup work for your module.

You can simply use '''File > New File > Module Development | Module Installer''' to create the <tt>ModuleInstall</tt> class and its registration in the manifest.
