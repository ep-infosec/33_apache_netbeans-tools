===What is a Mode in the Windowing System?===

"Mode" refers to "docking mode".  A Mode is a place in a main window, a place between splitters. Separate "floating" window is also backed by Mode. Mode is usually visually represented by a tabbed container.  Programmatically it is represented by the class <tt>org.openide.windows.Mode</tt>

Think of a <tt>Mode</tt> as synonymous with a one of the tabbed containers you see in the IDE's main window.  The name "Mode" is historical, and a bit unfortunate.  When you hear "Mode," think tabbed container and you'll be fine.

'''A Mode is ''not'' a GUI component'''.  There is no legitimate programmatic way to fetch the component that represents a Mode on-screen, and the windowing system makes no guarantees about what that component is.

Modes can contain one or more [[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| TopComponent]]s.  They may be visible or non-visible at any given time.

The [[DevFaqCustomWindowMode]] page has a visual representation of the available modes, and http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html has details about the contents of wstcref and settings files.

===Pre-Defined Modes===
NetBeans defines six modes in core.ui:
*topSlidingSide
*rightSlidingSide
*leftSlidingSide
*bottomSlidingSide
*explorer
*properties

NetBeans defines additional modes in other places:
*commonpalette
*output
*navigator
*editor
*CssPreviewTCWsmode

===Docking a TopComponent into a Mode===
To dock a TopComponent into the 'editor' mode:
<pre>
Mode myMode = WindowManager.getDefault().findMode("editor");
TopComponent myTopComponent = WindowManager.getDefault().findTopComponent("MyTopComponent");
myMode.dockInto(myTopComponent);
</pre>
''The ID string of the TopComponent can usually be found in that TopComponent's Java file where it gets registered using annotations, or in the layer.xml.
''
