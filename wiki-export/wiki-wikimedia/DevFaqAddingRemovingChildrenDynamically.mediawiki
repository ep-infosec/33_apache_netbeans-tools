===Can I add or remove children of a node on the fly?===

Yes.  Have your node subclass [http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/AbstractNode.html AbstractNode]
or whatever else you like.

'''NB 6 > m9 Specific''':
Implement <tt>ChildFactory</tt>.  To create the <tt>Children</tt> object for your Node, pass it to <tt>Children.create()</tt>.  When the child list needs updating, call <tt>refresh()</tt> on your <tt>ChildFactory</tt>.  Its <tt>createKeys</tt> method will be called again and you can update the set of key objects as needed;  Nodes for objects that remain in the list of keys will simply continue to exist;  additions and removals will be handled.

'''NB 5 And Earlier''':
Have your <tt>Children</tt> object subclass [http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/Children.Keys.html Children.Keys].
As needed, call <tt>setKeys()</tt> on the <tt>Children.Keys</tt> object.
Just by passing a larger or smaller (or reordered) list of keys, you will be adding or removing (or reordering) children.

Do not ''ever'' try to add/remove children from a node you
did not create (unless it has an API that explicitly gives you permission to do that); occasionally
people try to add child nodes to nodes for things like Java files.  If it works at all it's by accident.
