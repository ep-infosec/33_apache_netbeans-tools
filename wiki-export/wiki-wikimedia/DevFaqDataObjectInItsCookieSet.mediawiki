===The next button is never enabled when I create my DataObject from a template. Help!===

Most likely your <tt>DataObject</tt> does not put itself into its own <tt>CookieSet</tt>/<tt>Lookup</tt>.  If you call <tt>setCookieSet()</tt>, or override <tt>getLookup()</tt> or <tt>getCookie()</tt>, this can happen.  There are a few parts of NetBeans which will expect <tt>Node</tt>s to be present in their own <tt>Lookup</tt>s and <tt>DataObject</tt>s to be present in theirs.  It is always best to make sure they are there.  For a <tt>DataObject</tt>, the code for this is usually as simple as:

<pre>
getCookieSet().add(this);
</pre>
