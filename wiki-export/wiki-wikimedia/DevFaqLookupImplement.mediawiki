===How do I implement my own lookup or proxy another one?===

It is not uncommon to be subclassing a class, such as [[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| TopComponent]] or [[DevFaqWhatIsANode| Node]] which has a method <tt>getLookup()</tt>, and to need to add to or filter the original Lookup's contents.  There are a number of convenience factories and classes which make it easy to do this:

* [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html ProxyLookup] - a Lookup which takes an array of Lookups and merges them together.  Typical use is taking an existing lookup and providing it plus a lookup created with one of the convenience methods below
* [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#fixed(java.lang.Object...) Lookups.fixed(Object... arr)] - a static method that creates a Lookup with an array of persistent objects as its contents
* [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#singleton(java.lang.Object) Lookups.singleton (Object single)] - a static method that creates a Lookup with one object as its content
* [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/AbstractLookup.html AbstractLookup] - a Lookup which can have dynamic content - use it in conjunction with [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html InstanceContent], which you can add/remove things from

If you need to customize a Node's lookup, read [[DevFaqNodesCustomLookup| the FAQ item on how to do that]].
