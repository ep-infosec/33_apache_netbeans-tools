===How do I have only shortcut keys for an action?===

The '''New Action''' wizard allows you to uncheck both menu and toolbar placement for your action and only assign a keyboard shortcut. To learn how to do this manually, read on.
Refer to [[TaT_HackingNetBeansXMLLayerPartOne | TaT_HackingNetBeansXMLLayerPartOne]] for more details.

====Trick #1====
* Retain the action's basic registration:
<source lang="xml">
<folder name="Actions">
    <folder name="Tools">        
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
    </folder>
</folder>
</source>
* This registers an action as a '''Global Menu Item''':
<source lang="xml">
<folder name="Menu">
    <folder name="Tools">
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.shadow">
            <attr name="originalFile"
                  stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
            <attr name="position" intvalue="150"/>
        </file>
    </folder>
</folder>
</source>
* This registers an action as a '''Global Toolbar Button''':
<source lang="xml">
<folder name="Toolbars">
    <folder name="Build">
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.shadow">
            <attr name="originalFile"
                  stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
            <attr name="position" intvalue="325"/>
        </file>
    </folder>
</folder>
</source>
* To assign a shortcut key, replace either or both of them with something like the following:
<source lang="xml">
<folder name="Shortcuts">
    <file name="O-F3.shadow">
        <attr name="originalFile"
              stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
    </file>
</folder>
</source>

====Trick #2====
* In the above example the action has the shortcut key '''Alt+F3''', which is represented as <tt>O-F3</tt>. In general, if you have some key combination that uses '''Alt''' (or the equivalent on Mac OS X), then use <tt>O</tt>. Separate modifiers from the base keycode name with <tt>-</tt>, and append <tt>.shadow</tt> for the filename. '''Ctrl''' (or its Mac equivalent) is represented by <tt>D</tt>, and '''Shift'''by <tt>S</tt>. (<tt>C</tt> and <tt>A</tt> represent the literal '''Ctrl''' and '''Alt''' keys, but this is less portable.)

====Tips to Remember====
# Following are some keycode equivalents. See Javadoc for <tt>KeyEvent</tt> for the full list:
:* '''A''' to '''Z''' (as is), '''F1''' to '''F12''' (as is), '''0''' to '''9''' (as is)
:* '''/''' as <tt>SLASH</tt>, '''\''' as <tt>BACK_SLASH</tt>
:* ''';''' as <tt>SEMI_COLON</tt>
:* '''.''' as <tt>PERIOD</tt>
:* '''â€˜''' as <tt>QUOTE</tt>
