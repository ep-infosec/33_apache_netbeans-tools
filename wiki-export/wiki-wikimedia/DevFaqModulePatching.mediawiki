===How do I create a patch for a preexisting NetBeans module?===

If you need to patch an existing module, you can place a JAR file relative to the original.
For example, to patch <tt>ide/modules/org-openide-example.jar</tt>
you make a JAR like <tt>ide/modules/patches/org-openide-example/mypatch.jar</tt>.
The <tt>mypatch</tt> part of your JAR file patch can be named anything you like.
The JAR file should only contain those classes you want to patch.
It does not need a manifest, though an empty manifest is harmless.

The patch must be in the same cluster as the original. ({{iz|69794}})
If you want to create an NBM containing a patch,
you must ensure it will be installed in the same cluster
(use the <tt>nbm.target.cluster</tt> property),
but note that you cannot test such a dummy module as part of a module suite
(since this property is interpreted only by Plugin Manager).
If you are distributing a complete application including a patch to the NB Platform,
you will need to either manually preinstall the patch JAR in your copy of the Platform;
or override your <tt>build-zip</tt> target to include the JAR in the final ZIP
(in which case testing using '''Run Project''' will not have the patch active).
