===What is the "default lookup"?===

The default lookup is <tt>Lookup.getDefault()</tt>.
It is the registry for global singletons and instances of objects which have been registered in the system by modules.
(In JDK 6, <tt>ServiceLoader</tt> operates on the same principle.)
The default lookup searches in two places:

* The [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#metaInfServices(java.lang.ClassLoader) META-INF/services/ Lookup] contains all objects registered by modules via the [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/extensions/ Java Extension Mechanism] - putting files in the <tt>META-INF/services/</tt> directory of their module JARs (typically done using the [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ServiceProvider.html <tt>@ServiceProvider</tt>] annotation)
* The contents of the <tt>Services/</tt> folder of the [[DevFaqSystemFilesystem|System (configuration) Filesystem]] (this is harder and somewhat deprecated)

Objects contained in the default lookup are instantiated lazily when first requested.  Objects returned by the default lookup ''may'' (or may not) be garbage collected if they become unreferenced.

Here is the usual usage pattern:

1. A central "controller" module defines some interface, e.g.

<source lang="java">
package controller.pkg;
public interface MyService {
    void doSomething();
}
</source>

2. Each module which wants to implement that service depends on the controller module which defines the interface, and creates and registers an implementation:

<source lang="java">
@ServiceProvider(service=MyService.class)
public class MyImpl implements MyService {
    public void doSomething() {....}
}
</source>

It is also possible to declaratively mask other people's implementations and declaratively order implementations so some will take precedence.

3. The controller finds all implementations and uses them somehow:

<source lang="java">
for (MyService s : Lookup.getDefault().lookupAll(MyService.class)) {
    s.doSomething();
}
</source>
