===I have a folder full of .instance files. How do I get any/all of the object instances?===

Often registries of objects are created by placing files with the extension <code>.instance</code> into some folder in the [[DevFaqSystemFilesystem| system filesystem]].  The task, then, is to turn a folder full of files into a collection of objects, and make sure we only get objects of the type we are interested in.  In NetBeans 6 it is very simple to do that:
<source lang="java">
Lookup myObjects = Lookups.forPath ("path/to/folder/in/sysfs");
Collection <? extends MyType> c = myObjects.lookupAll(MyType.class);
</source>
(note the separator is always / with NetBeans filesystems).

If you have a single <code>.instance</code> file and need to get an object for that, [[DevFaqFindInstance| see this FAQ entry]].
