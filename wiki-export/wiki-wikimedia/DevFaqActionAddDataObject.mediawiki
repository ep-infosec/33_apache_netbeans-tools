===How do I add an action to my custom node type ?===

Override the <tt>public Action[[ | ]] getActions(boolean context)</tt> method of your node (99% of the time you can ignore the boolean parameter).

If this node is really a <tt>DataNode</tt> for your own file type, instead see
[[DevFaqActionAddFileMime | DevFaqActionAddFileMime]].
