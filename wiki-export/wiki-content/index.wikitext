This is the developer-oriented FAQ for NetBeans IDE 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and 8.x. ''Developer'' in this context means "person writing NetBeans extension modules (plug-ins), or applications based on the NetBeans Platform".  Don't see your developer-oriented question here? Ask on [http://netbeans.org/projects/platform/lists/dev/archive <tt>dev@platform.netbeans.org</tt>] ([http://netbeans.org/community/lists/top.html subscribe to post]).  Not writing modules?  See the [[FaqIndex| list of other FAQs]].

Here's [[HowToAddFAQEntries|How To Add FAQ Entries]].  One Big Important Thing about adding developer FAQ entries:  If they don't start with "DevFaq" they are not going to get indexed properly.  Please add items, but please follow this simple guideline.
