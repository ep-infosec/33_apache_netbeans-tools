===What is an Explorer view?===

An explorer view is a GUI component which can display a [[DevFaqWhatIsANode| Node ]] and (optionally) its child nodes.  While Nodes are, by definition, a tree structure, explorer views are much more than just JTrees.  Here is a list of the components available:

* BeanTreeView - the classic tree view, as seen in the Projects and Files tabs in the IDE
* ListView - a JList based node view component - you can see it in the right hand list in
* ChoiceView - a ComboBox based explorer view - older versions of the NetBeans IDE used this to display a list of methods in the editor toolbar
* ContextTreeView - like a BeanTreeView, but sets its manager's explorered context.  The "master" part of a master-detail component that uses two views.
* MenuView - a JMenu view of a Node and its children
* TableView - an Explorer view displaying nodes in a table.
* TreeTableView - a TreeTable view of a Node and its children, in which the left column of the table is a tree of nodes, and the other columns display/edit a specified set of properties of those nodes
* OutlineView - replacement for TreeTableView
* IconView - a view similar to that of the left pane in Windows Explorer - a table of equidistant icons.  Not currently used anywhere in the IDE's UI.
* PropertySheetView - doesn't show Nodes per-se at all, but rather, shows a property sheet for editing a Node's properties
&lt;!--   * ListTableView - similar to a TreeTable, but with a list, not a tree (unused and long unmaintained - may not be working) --&gt;

With the exception of PropertySheetView, all of these classes live in the package &lt;tt&gt;org.openide.explorer.view&lt;/tt&gt; (sources in openide/explorer in [[DevFaqAccessSourcesUsingCvs| NetBeans' CVS]]).

An explorer view's content is controlled by its [[DevFaqExplorerManager| ExplorerManager]] - you don't set the root node directly on the view component, you use its manager.  This is so that more than one view can share a single manager, to do master-detail views (for example, the first page of the New Project wizard is one such view - the right hand panel displays children of the left hand panel's selection).

There are a number of advantages to using Nodes and Explorer Views
* it is possible to create a rich UI with very little UI code
* they integrate well with standard menu/toolbar actions that are sensitive to selection
* they contain convenient and well tested features (start randomly typing in a tree or list view - a little popup will appear and search for a matching node)
* there is a lot of logic built into NetBeans for creating Nodes simply and easily, for example, from [http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/BeanNode.html any POJO JavaBean] and persisting the things they represent, so you can do a lot with very little code by using Nodes and Explorer Views

A common usage is to get a Node for some folder on disk or in the [[DevFaqSystemFilesystem| configuration filesystem]], optionally create a &lt;tt&gt;FilterNode&lt;/tt&gt; to filter out some child nodes of it or its children, and display that.</text>
