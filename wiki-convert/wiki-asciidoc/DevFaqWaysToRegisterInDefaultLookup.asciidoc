== Which Way Should I Use To Register an Object in the Default Lookup?

There are two ways to put something in the link:DevFaqLookupDefault.html[default Lookup]:

|===
|What |When to Use It |How 

|Use the `@ServiceProvider` annotation |Most of the time, unless you are building with Maven.  This annotation relies on NetBeans' build infrastructure to generate flat files in `META-INF/services` described below, at compile time. |Annotate your file with `@ServiceProvider(service=Something.class)` 

|Put an `.instance` file in your module layer in `Services/Hidden` |Rarely - useful if you are making services available dynamically on the fly, for example when link:DevFaqDynamicSystemFilesystem.html[dynamically changing layer contents], or when link:DevFaqFileAttributes.html[specialized registration metadata] or factory methods are needed |Declare a link:DevFaqInstanceDataObject.html[.instance file], a link:DevFaqDotSettingsFiles.html[.settings file] or similar, or a link:DevFaqDotShadowFiles.html[.shadow file] in your module's link:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.html[layer.xml file]
